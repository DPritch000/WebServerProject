                    <h3>💧 Stay Hydrated</h3>

                    <p>Fuel your body with a mix of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Protein helps muscle recovery, carbs provide energy, and healthy fats support hormone production. Eat a meal 2-3 hours before exercising.</p>

                    <h3>😴 Get Quality Sleep</h3>
